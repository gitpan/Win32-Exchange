It's possible that some of the ADODB searches could fail
if they return more than 100 results (with the exception of
_ADODBExtendedSearch), because of limitations on your Exchange
server, the programming fix is to make a "paged search", that requests
blocks of data smaller than the maximum search size (default is 100)
and return the result set in its entirety while staying within the limits
set forth by your Exchange server (E55).

A paged search was created in _ADODBExtendedSearch as a testing measure, and
eventually all the ADODB searches will be changed so that they "page".
